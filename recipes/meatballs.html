        <ol>
            <li>
                Sauté onion in 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                Stir garlic into onion and turn off heat. 
                Transfer onion mixture to a large mixing bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir ground beef, ricotta cheese, parsley, egg, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper with onion mixture until almost combined; 
                stir in bread crumbs and continue to mix until thoroughly blended.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll about 2 tablespoons of mixture into a 1-inch ball for each meatball. 
                Pour remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in same skillet used to cook onions. 
                Place skillet over medium heat and brown meatballs on all sides in hot oil, about 5 minutes. Hold a crumpled paper towel in tongs and use it to remove excess grease from skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
               Pour marinara sauce and water over meatballs in skillet. 
               Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. 
               Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meatballs are cooked through and no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.
